The SOLID principles guide C++ design for maintainability. Classes have a single responsibility, allowing extension without modification. Derived classes seamlessly replace their base, and small focused interfaces promote loose coupling. Depends on abstractions, not specifics, for flexible and adaptable code.

The SOLID principles are a set of five design principles for writing clean, maintainable, and scalable object-oriented code. They were introduced by Robert C. Martin (also known as Uncle Bob) and have become fundamental concepts in software engineering. Here's a brief overview of each principle:

1. Single Responsibility Principle (SRP):
   - A class should have only one reason to change, meaning it should have only one responsibility or purpose.
   - Breaking down functionality into smaller, cohesive units helps in maintaining and extending the codebase without affecting unrelated parts.

2. Open/Closed Principle (OCP):
   - Software entities (classes, modules, functions) should be open for extension but closed for modification.
   - This means that you should be able to add new functionality without altering existing code. Achieve this through inheritance, polymorphism, and interfaces.

3. Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP):
   - Objects of a superclass should be replaceable with objects of its subclasses without affecting the correctness of the program.
   - Subtypes must be substitutable for their base types without altering the desirable properties of the program.

4. Interface Segregation Principle (ISP):
   - Clients should not be forced to depend on interfaces they do not use.
   - Instead of having one large interface, break it down into smaller, more specific interfaces, each serving a distinct purpose. This promotes loose coupling and better encapsulation.

5. Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP):
   - High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions.
   - Abstractions should not depend on details; rather, details should depend on abstractions.
   - By depending on abstractions rather than concrete implementations, you decouple components, making the code more flexible, reusable, and easier to test.

These principles collectively aim to promote good software design practices such as modularity, maintainability, extensibility, and reusability. Following SOLID principles leads to code that is easier to understand, refactor, and maintain, and it also encourages the development of more robust and scalable software systems.
